Hey there! I'm a physicist diving deep into the world of Complex Networks. My main jams are Complex Systems, Opinion Dynamics, and the wild impacts of Climate Change. I mix in some Game Theory to tackle all sorts of business challenges – it's pretty cool how it all connects!

I love teaming up with folks from social sciences, politics, psychology, and biology to come up with creative solutions for tough problems. Being a student tutor taught me a lot about leading teams and making learning fun and collaborative.

I'm on the lookout for a fresh, innovative environment where I can put my skills to use, helping to drive growth and solve challenges in Complex Systems. Let’s make something awesome together!
